# Train Scheduler

Train Scheduler is an application that allows users to submit train information to a database and observe the train arrival time update in realtime.  I used Firebase as the realtime database to store the train information and Moment.js to work with dates and time more easily and display them to the user.  Anytime the database is updates with a new train or the page is refreshed the train times will be updated.
